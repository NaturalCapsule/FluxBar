## STILL IN PROGRESS....

# this is just a basic taskbar, maybe in the future i will make it more advance!.

to use this app copy the command below, open your terminal and paste it:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

in the `config/config.ini` file you can add apps, change layouts. and within the style.css you can make your own style!.

for monitoring GPU it only works with nvidia gpus not with AMD or Intel gpus!!
