Caution! make sure you are using python 3.9 when downloading
libraries because a library supports python 3.9
or you can just make an env!

# READ THE `config.ini` IN THE CONFIG FOLDER I'VE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING.



to use this app copy the command below, open your terminal and paste it:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

in the `config/config.ini` file you can add apps, change layouts. and within the style.css you can make your own style!.
